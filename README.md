# 🧠 DSA — Data Structures & Algorithms

Welcome to the **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** repository!  
This repository contains well-structured and categorized implementations of **core DSA concepts in C**, designed to help learners and contributors understand, visualize, and implement algorithms efficiently.

---

## 📚 Overview

This repository is divided into multiple sections, each focusing on a specific **data structure** or **algorithmic concept**.  
Each folder includes:
- Source code in **C**
- Explanations (via inline comments or separate READMEs)
- Example programs demonstrating core operations

## 📂 Repository Structure

| Folder Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| 🔗 **[Single_Linked_List](./Single_Linked_List)** | Implementation of singly linked lists (insertion, deletion, reversal, concatenation, etc.) |
| 🔁 **[Circular_Linked_List](./Circular_Linked_List)** | Implementation of circular linked lists |
| ↔️ **[Doubly_Linked_List](./Doubly_Linked_List)** | Implementation of doubly linked lists |
| 🌳 **[Binary_Search_Tree](./Binary_Search_Tree)** | Implementation of binary search trees with traversal and insertion |
| 🧮 **[Graph](./Graph)** | Basic graph representation and traversal algorithms |
| 🔍 **[Searching](./Searching)** | Linear search and binary search algorithms |
| 🧩 **[Sorting](./Sorting)** | Sorting algorithms like Bubble, Insertion, Selection, and Quick sort |

## 🧠 About Each Section

Each sub-folder (e.g., `Single_Linked_List`, `Graph`, `Sorting`, etc.) contains:
- A **dedicated C program**
- A **README.md file** (where applicable) explaining:
  - Concept overview  
  - Code structure  
  - Example input/output  

So, for detailed understanding and execution steps — check the **README of each respective folder**.
